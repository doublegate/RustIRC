Software Design and Development Plan: RustIRC
Part I: Strategic Vision and Core Principles
The Modern IRC Imperative: Identifying the Market Opportunity
The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol, valued for its simplicity, open standards, and resilient communities, maintains a dedicated user base.[1, 2] However, the client software ecosystem has largely stagnated, creating a significant opportunity for a modern, full-featured application. The primary catalyst for this opportunity is the discontinuation of the HexChat client in early 2024.[3, 4] For years, HexChat served as the de facto standard for users seeking a free, graphical, and cross-platform client that was more accessible than terminal-based options but more modern than legacy software.[5, 6] Its absence has left a notable void in the market and a large user base without a clear, actively maintained successor.

This void is amplified by the limitations of the remaining incumbent clients. mIRC, while renowned for its powerful scripting capabilities, remains proprietary, Windows-only shareware with an interface design that feels dated to modern users.[3, 7] Its powerful event-driven scripting is a key feature that RustIRC will seek to emulate and modernize. On the other end of the spectrum, WeeChat is lauded for its efficiency, modularity, and cutting-edge protocol support, but its terminal-based user experience presents a formidable barrier to entry for a majority of users.[3, 8] The broader IRC client landscape is fragmented, with many alternatives lacking comprehensive features, active maintenance, or full compliance with modern standards like IRCv3.[5]

The confluence of HexChat's cessation, the maturity and momentum of the Rust programming language, and the enduring appeal of IRC's decentralized philosophy creates an ideal moment to introduce a new, definitive client.[1] A critical lesson from HexChat's history is the risk of project stagnation due to "maintainer burnout," a common failure mode for open-source projects built on large, complex C codebases.[4, 9] Such codebases are difficult for new contributors to approach due to complex memory management and a lack of modern tooling, placing an immense burden on a few core developers. The choice of Rust for this project is therefore not merely a technical decision for performance and memory safety; it is a strategic one aimed at ensuring long-term project viability. Rust's modern toolchain, strong safety guarantees, and growing developer community make it a more attractive and accessible platform for fostering the community contribution necessary to avoid the fate of its predecessors.[3]

RustIRC: A Synthesis of Proven Concepts
RustIRC is not designed to reinvent IRC but to perfect the client experience by synthesizing the most beloved features of its predecessors into a single, cohesive application. This "best-of-breed" approach ensures that the final product is both powerful and familiar to a wide range of users.[3]

From mIRC: The Power of Scripting. The project will adopt mIRC's powerful event-driven scripting model, which allows users to automate responses, create custom commands (aliases), and build complex pop-up dialogs.[7, 10] This deep customizability is the primary reason for mIRC's enduring popularity. However, RustIRC will replace the proprietary and historically insecure mIRC Scripting Language (mSL) with a modern, sandboxed Lua engine, leveraging a mature crate like mlua.[11] This provides comparable power within a standard, safer, and more performant environment.

From HexChat: The User-Friendly GUI. The client will emulate HexChat's clean, intuitive graphical user interface, including its popular tabbed and tree-style views for channel management and a straightforward network configuration dialog.[3, 4] This design made HexChat the ideal entry point for new IRC users. RustIRC will innovate by building this GUI with a modern, Rust-native toolkit like Iced [12], enabling a more polished, responsive, and thematically consistent experience across all platforms without the heavy dependency on system-level libraries like GTK.[13] Furthermore, it will address common user complaints by incorporating more flexible window layout options, such as the side-by-side channel views characteristic of WeeChat or mIRC's MDI.[3]

From WeeChat: Efficiency and Modularity. Architecturally, RustIRC will borrow WeeChat's philosophy of a lightweight core extended by plugins.[8] This ensures the client remains efficient and highly extensible. For power users who prefer a terminal-based workflow, RustIRC will provide an optional, high-fidelity Terminal User Interface (TUI) mode built with the ratatui crate.[14] While WeeChat's core is single-threaded [15], RustIRC will leverage Rust's powerful concurrency model with the Tokio runtime.[16, 17] This allows network I/O, file transfers, and script execution to run in parallel across multiple threads without blocking the user interface, representing a significant architectural advancement.

The following table codifies this synthesis, serving as a high-level strategic guide for development.

|

| Feature Area | mIRC (Strengths/Weaknesses) | HexChat (Strengths/Weaknesses) | WeeChat (Strengths/Weaknesses) | RustIRC's Synthesized Approach |
| Scripting | S: Extremely powerful, event-driven (mSL). W: Proprietary, insecure, Windows-only. [3, 7] | S: Multi-language (Python, Perl, Lua). W: Less integrated/powerful than mSL. [3, 18] | S: Vast language support, script manager. W: TUI-focused, complex API. [3, 8] | A powerful, sandboxed Lua engine for mIRC-like event handling, plus a binary plugin API for Rust extensions. A WeeChat-inspired script manager for discovery and installation. |
| User Interface | S: Familiar MDI, context menus. W: Outdated, Windows-only, cluttered. [3, 7] | S: Clean, intuitive, tabbed/tree view, cross-platform. W: Stagnant, inflexible layout. [3, 4] | S: Highly efficient, keyboard-driven, splits. W: Steep learning curve, no official GUI. [3, 8] | A modern, cross-platform GUI (Iced) emulating HexChat's ease of use, but with advanced window splitting/tiling like WeeChat. A first-class TUI mode (ratatui) for power users. |
| Architecture | S: Robust, feature-complete. W: Closed-source, monolithic. [7] | S: Open-source. W: Monolithic C codebase, hard to maintain. [9] | S: Highly modular, plugin-based, lightweight core.

Core functionality and protocols are implemented as internal plugins, inspired by WeeChat's design. |
| Protocol Support | S: Supports modern standards (SASL, IRCv3). W: Slower to adopt new specs. [19] | S: Good support for SASL, DCC. W: Stagnant, lagging on newest IRCv3 specs. [18] | S: Excellent, cutting-edge IRCv3 support. W: N/A. [3] | Comprehensive, first-class support for all modern IRCv3 specs [20, 21], robust DCC with resume/reverse [22, 23], and all major SASL mechanisms.[24, 25] |

Foundational Principles
The development of RustIRC will be guided by several non-negotiable principles derived from its strategic goals.

Security by Default: Rust's compile-time memory safety guarantees will be leveraged to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, that are common in clients written in C/C++.[26] All network connections will default to using TLS via rustls, and the scripting engine will be strictly sandboxed to prevent the kind of abuse historically associated with mIRC scripts.[3, 7]

Performance and Efficiency: The application must be lightweight and responsive, capable of handling hundreds of active channels with minimal CPU and memory overhead, rivaling the benchmark set by WeeChat.[3] This will be achieved through Rust's zero-cost abstractions and Tokio's highly efficient, non-blocking I/O model.[16, 17]

Deep Extensibility: The architecture will be designed around a powerful plugin and scripting API from its inception. This is a core feature, not an afterthought, ensuring the client can evolve and adapt alongside the community and the IRC protocol itself.[3]

First-Class Cross-Platform Experience: RustIRC will provide a native look, feel, and integration on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This includes using platform-native notifications and file dialogs, and respecting operating system conventions for configuration file locations, a direct improvement over clients that use a single, non-native UI toolkit across all platforms.[3]

Maintainability and Openness: The project will be fully open-source under a permissive license (e.g., GPL-3.0), featuring a modular codebase, comprehensive test coverage, and clear documentation to encourage community contributions and ensure long-term viability.[3]

Part II: Comprehensive Feature and Protocol Specifications
IRC Protocol Adherence
RustIRC will be engineered for complete and robust compliance with modern IRC standards, ensuring seamless interoperability with all major IRC daemons and networks.

Core Compliance: The client will fully adhere to the "Modern IRC" specification, which consolidates and supersedes historical documents like RFC 1459 and RFC 2812.[20] This includes correct handling of message framing, default UTF-8 character encoding, and all standard IRC commands.

IRCv3 Capability Negotiation: The connection handshake will be built around the CAP command, a cornerstone of IRCv3.[20] Upon connecting, the client will issue CAP LS 302 to list all server-supported capabilities. It will then request the full set of capabilities it implements using CAP REQ. The client will also correctly handle dynamic capability changes during a session via CAP NEW, CAP DEL, and CAP ACK notifications.[21]

IRCv3 Message Tags: The internal message parser will be designed from the ground up to natively handle IRCv3 message tags.[27] This is a foundational requirement, as most modern IRCv3 extensions rely on this metadata mechanism. The implementation will correctly parse key-value pairs, handle specified character escaping, and respect defined size limits.

Key IRCv3 Extensions: To provide a rich and modern user experience, particularly on networks like Libera.Chat, the following extensions will be implemented with high priority: server-time for accurate message timestamps crucial for bouncer integration; account-tag and account-notify to reliably associate users with their registered accounts; multi-prefix to correctly display all user channel modes; away-notify for instant status updates; and chathistory and batch to handle message history playback without overwhelming the UI.[3, 21]

The following table provides a prioritized checklist for the implementation of IRCv3 extensions.

| Extension | Specification | Priority | Implementation Notes |
| capability-negotiation | spec | Core | Foundational. Must support CAP LS 302, REQ, ACK, NAK, NEW, DEL. |
| message-tags | spec | Core | Foundational. Parser must handle escaped values and client-only tags. |
| sasl | spec | Core | See Section 2.3 for detailed SASL mechanism support. |
| server-time | spec | High | Use this timestamp for display and logging. Fallback to local time if unavailable. |
| account-notify | spec | High | Update internal user state with account name. Essential for reliable user identification. |
| multi-prefix | spec | High | Nicklist must correctly parse and display all prefixes received in NAMES replies. |
| away-notify | spec | High | Update nicklist UI (e.g., dimming color) based on away status. |
| chathistory | spec | Medium | Implement commands to request history. Integrate with batch for smooth display. |
| batch | spec | Medium | UI should buffer messages within a batch and render them at once to prevent lag. |
| extended-join | spec | Medium | Parse account name and realname from JOIN messages to populate user data immediately. |
| invite-notify | spec | Low | Provide a server/channel notification when a user is invited. |

Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) Protocol Suite
Despite its age, the DCC protocol remains a critical feature for many IRC communities, enabling direct file sharing and private conversations that bypass the central server.[28, 29] RustIRC will provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly implementation of the full DCC suite.

DCC CHAT: The client will handle the complete CTCP handshake (DCC CHAT chat <ip> <port>).[29] All incoming requests will trigger a UI prompt asking the user for confirmation, which will include a clear warning that accepting will expose their IP address to the other user. Accepted DCC chats will open in a new, query-like window, distinctly marked as a direct, unencrypted connection.[3]

DCC SEND/RECV: Full support for the DCC SEND handshake will be implemented.[30] The UI will feature a user-friendly file picker for sending files and a clear accept/decline dialog for receiving them, showing the filename and size. This dialog will enforce saving files only to a user-configured, safe download directory. A dedicated transfer manager window will display all ongoing transfers with progress bars, transfer speeds, and estimated time remaining.[3]

DCC RESUME: A crucial usability feature, the client will fully implement the DCC RESUME and DCC ACCEPT commands, allowing interrupted file transfers to be continued from the point of failure.[3, 30] The client will maintain a state file for partial downloads to facilitate this process.

Passive / Reverse DCC: To overcome common issues with Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewalls, the client will have first-class support for Reverse DCC.[3, 23] The client will be able to intelligently offer or accept Reverse DCC connections (by sending or receiving port 0 in the handshake), automating the process where possible while providing manual overrides for power users.

Security and Usability: A stretch goal is the implementation of Secure DCC (SDCC), which wraps the direct connection in a TLS session, providing a significant security advantage over older clients that transmit DCC data in plaintext.[22]

Secure Authentication (SASL) Mechanisms
Secure and seamless authentication is a cornerstone of modern IRC. RustIRC will provide comprehensive support for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), tightly integrated into the connection process.

Integration with Capability Negotiation: SASL authentication will be handled as part of the IRCv3 CAP flow. The client will request the sasl capability and, if the server acknowledges it, will proceed with the AUTHENTICATE command sequence before completing the connection registration and joining channels.[20, 31]

Supported Mechanisms: To ensure broad compatibility with modern IRC networks, RustIRC will support the three most important SASL mechanisms [24, 25]:

PLAIN: The most basic mechanism, which sends credentials encoded in Base64. This mechanism will only ever be used over a TLS-encrypted connection, and the UI will enforce this for user security.[32]

EXTERNAL: Enables authentication using a client-side TLS certificate. The network configuration UI will allow users to specify a path to their certificate and private key files, catering to security-conscious users and networks that support this method.

SCRAM-SHA-256: A modern, secure challenge-response mechanism that avoids transmitting the user's password directly. This will be the preferred authentication method whenever both the client and server support it.

User Configuration: The network settings UI will feature a dedicated authentication section. Users can select their preferred mechanism, enter credentials (which will be stored securely), and specify a client certificate. A fallback option to use traditional NickServ IDENTIFY commands will be available for legacy networks or if SASL authentication fails.[3]

Extensibility Framework: Scripting and Plugins
The extensibility framework is a core pillar of RustIRC's design, aiming to combine the legendary power of mIRC scripting with the modern safety and language diversity of HexChat and WeeChat.[3]

Embedded Lua Engine: Lua is selected as the primary scripting language for its small footprint, simple syntax, performance, and excellent sandboxing capabilities. The integration will be handled by a mature and actively maintained crate like mlua.[11] A comprehensive API will be exposed to Lua scripts, enabling them to hook into any client or IRC event, send commands, query client state, create custom slash commands, and perform limited, safe UI manipulations.

Binary Plugin Architecture: For more powerful extensions, RustIRC will support dynamically loaded binary plugins. A stable Rust Application Binary Interface (ABI) will be defined using a plugin trait, and plugins (as .so, .dll, or .dylib files) will be loaded at runtime. This allows for performance-critical extensions, implementations of new protocols (such as Off-the-Record (OTR) encryption), or the creation of custom UI widgets.[3] The plugin system will be designed to isolate plugins to prevent a faulty plugin from crashing the main application.

Script/Plugin Manager: Inspired by WeeChat's /script command [3, 8], RustIRC will include a graphical manager for extensions. This tool will allow users to easily browse, install, update, and manage scripts and plugins from a curated community repository. This feature dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for customization, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of user-created content.

User-Facing Feature Compendium
Beyond core protocol support, RustIRC will include a rich set of features designed to enhance usability and empower users.

Advanced UI:

Window Splitting/Tiling: Moving beyond a simple tabbed interface, the client will allow users to split the main window into multiple panes to view several channels or queries simultaneously, a key feature for power users familiar with WeeChat.[3]

Customizable Theming: A simple, accessible theming system (e.g., based on TOML or a CSS-like syntax) will allow users to customize all colors, fonts, and major layout elements.

Context Menus: Powerful, mIRC-style right-click context menus on user nicknames and channel names will provide quick access to common actions like WHOIS, query, op, kick, and ban.[3]

Notifications: The client will integrate with native OS notification systems on Windows (Toast Notifications), macOS (Notification Center), and Linux (DBus-based notifications) for highlights and private messages, with fine-grained user controls.

Comprehensive Utilities: The client will include robust per-channel logging with configurable formats and rotation; full support for SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies; and first-class integration with IRC bouncers like ZNC, ensuring correct message history playback.[3]

Part III: System Architecture and Technical Design
High-Level Architectural Blueprint
RustIRC will be built upon a modular, event-driven, message-passing architecture. This modern design is inspired by the reactive patterns found in frameworks like Elm and Iced [12], providing the modularity of WeeChat but with superior concurrency and testability. The application's major components—Network, Core Logic, and UI—will be developed as largely independent crates within a single Cargo workspace, communicating via a central, asynchronous event bus.

This architectural choice directly addresses the long-term maintainability challenges observed in older, monolithic C/C++ clients.[9, 33] By decoupling components, the system becomes far easier to test, refactor, and extend. The network layer can be tested without a UI, the UI can be tested with mock data, and the core logic can be verified by injecting mock events and asserting on the resulting state. This structure significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors, which is critical for the project's long-term health and ability to avoid the stagnation that befell HexChat.

The Network Layer
The Network Layer is responsible for all communication with external servers. It is built to be highly concurrent and robust.

Async Runtime: The Tokio runtime will serve as the foundation for all asynchronous operations.[16, 17] Its high-performance, multi-threaded, work-stealing scheduler is perfectly suited for managing numerous concurrent network tasks, such as connections to multiple IRC servers and parallel DCC file transfers.

Connection Management: Each connection to an IRC server will be managed by a dedicated Tokio task. This task will own the underlying TCP stream and its associated read/write loop, isolating connection-specific logic and state.

TLS/SSL: tokio-rustls will be used for all TLS encryption. rustls is a modern, pure-Rust TLS implementation that avoids the complexities and potential security vulnerabilities of linking against system-level libraries like OpenSSL, a dependency that complicated builds for HexChat.[34]

IRC Message Parsing/Serialization: A custom, high-performance, zero-copy-oriented parser will be developed in its own dedicated crate (rustirc-parser). While existing crates are available, a custom implementation is necessary to guarantee full and correct support for the nuances of the IRCv3 message tag specification and to optimize for performance-critical paths.[27] This parser will be subjected to rigorous fuzz testing to ensure its robustness against malformed network input.

The Core Logic Layer
The Core Logic Layer is the brain of the application, mediating between the network and the user interface.

State Management: The client's complete state—including all connected servers, joined channels, user lists, and associated metadata—will be held within a central, thread-safe data structure. Access to this state will be managed either through locks (e.g., Arc<Mutex>) or, preferably, by message passing to a dedicated state-management task to prevent contention.

Event Dispatcher: The heart of the core logic is the event dispatcher, implemented as an asynchronous broadcast channel (e.g., tokio::sync::broadcast). It receives events from the Network Layer (e.g., a parsed PRIVMSG) and the Presentation Layer (e.g., a user-initiated /join command) and broadcasts them to all interested subscribers.

Subscribers: Components within the core, such as the State Manager and the Plugin Host, will subscribe to the event bus. They will listen for relevant events, update the central state, execute commands, and dispatch new events as needed, creating a reactive and decoupled system.

The Presentation Layer (UI/TUI)
The Presentation Layer is responsible for rendering the application state for the user and capturing user input. It is designed to be a "thin" layer, containing minimal logic.

GUI Framework: Iced is the primary choice for the graphical interface.[12] Its pure-Rust, cross-platform nature and reactive architecture align perfectly with the project's core design principles. It eliminates the need for external C-based dependencies like GTK, which vastly simplifies the build and distribution process—a key lesson from HexChat's complex dependency graph.[13] The modern, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic of the project's branding (Image 1, Image 2) is more readily achieved with a custom-rendered UI like Iced than with traditional widget toolkits. The primary risk is Iced's relative maturity compared to gtk-rs [35, 36]; this will be mitigated by an early-phase prototyping spike to validate its performance for core features like rendering large, color-formatted text buffers.

TUI Framework: ratatui is the definitive choice for the optional terminal UI.[14] As the well-maintained community successor to tui-rs, it is the standard for building complex TUIs in Rust.

Integration: Both the GUI and TUI frontends will subscribe to state update events from the Core Logic Layer. When new state is received, they will re-render their views. User input is packaged into command events and dispatched back to the core for processing.

Technology Stack and Dependencies
The selection of technologies and libraries is driven by the principles of performance, security, and long-term maintainability.

| Component | Selected Crate/Technology | Rationale & Risk Mitigation |
| Async Runtime | tokio | Industry standard, high performance, multi-threaded scheduler. Well-suited for concurrent network tasks. [16, 17] |
| GUI Framework | iced | Pure-Rust, cross-platform, modern reactive model. Simplifies builds vs. C-bindings. Risk: Maturity. Mitigation: Early prototyping; gtk-rs as a fallback. [12, 35] |
| TUI Framework | ratatui | De facto standard for Rust TUIs. Robust, well-documented, and actively maintained. [14] |
| TLS/Security | rustls (via tokio-rustls) | Modern, pure-Rust TLS library. Avoids OpenSSL dependency issues and associated vulnerabilities. [3] |
| Scripting Engine | mlua | High-level, safe bindings for Lua. Actively maintained fork of rlua. Provides sandboxing capabilities. [11] |
| Configuration | serde + toml | serde is the standard for Rust serialization. TOML is human-readable and well-suited for configuration files. [3] |
| Cross-Platform Dirs | directories | Provides reliable, OS-conventional paths for config/data/cache directories, ensuring good platform citizenship. [3] |
| CLI Parsing | clap | Powerful and standard crate for parsing command-line arguments (e.g., --tui mode). [3] |

Part IV: Phased Implementation Plan
Development will proceed in seven distinct phases, allowing for incremental progress, early feedback, and risk mitigation. This plan ensures that a functional core is established early, upon which more advanced features are layered.

Phase 1: Research, Design, and Project Setup (Weeks 1-2)
This foundational phase involves finalizing technical choices and establishing the project infrastructure. Tasks include a deep analysis of competing clients, finalizing the choice of GUI library via rapid prototyping, initializing the GitHub repository with a Cargo workspace structure, and defining coding standards and CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions.[3] The key milestone is an approved design and a buildable project skeleton.

Phase 2: Core IRC Engine Development (Weeks 3-6)
The focus shifts to implementing the fundamental networking and protocol logic. This includes creating the async connection manager with Tokio, developing the IRCv3-compliant message parser, defining the core data models for servers and channels, and implementing basic commands (NICK, JOIN, PRIVMSG) and SASL PLAIN authentication. The deliverable is a rudimentary command-line prototype capable of connecting to a server, joining a channel, and exchanging messages, proving the viability of the core engine.[3]

Phase 3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation (Weeks 7-10)
This phase brings the client to life with a graphical interface. Using the chosen framework (Iced), developers will build the main UI components: the server/channel tree, the formatted chat display area, the user input box with history and tab-completion, and the network configuration dialog. This UI will be integrated with the core engine from Phase 2 via the event bus. The milestone is a runnable alpha version of RustIRC that can be used for basic, daily IRC chatting on Windows and Linux.[3]

Phase 4: Scripting and Plugin System (Weeks 11-14)
Here, the critical extensibility features are introduced. The Lua scripting engine will be embedded using mlua, and the core event system will be exposed via a safe API. The architecture for loading binary Rust plugins will be established. Example scripts and a basic alias system will be created to demonstrate the system's power. The milestone is a client whose behavior can be significantly customized by users through Lua scripts, achieving a key feature parity with mIRC and HexChat.[3]

Phase 5: Advanced Features and Protocol Extensions (Weeks 15-18)
This phase aims for feature completeness. Development will focus on implementing the full DCC protocol suite, including file transfers with resume and reverse DCC. SASL support will be extended to include EXTERNAL and SCRAM-SHA-256. Further IRCv3 extensions like chathistory will be implemented. Native OS notifications will be integrated. The deliverable is a feature-complete beta version of the client, ready for wider testing.[3]

Phase 6: Testing, Optimization, and Stabilization (Weeks 19-22)
Quality assurance is the sole focus of this phase. The team will conduct comprehensive testing across all three target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), paying special attention to cross-platform bugs. Performance profiling will be used to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in both the UI and core logic. The UI will be polished, accessibility will be reviewed, and all user-facing documentation will be finalized. The milestone is a stable, performant, and well-documented Release Candidate (RC).[3]

Phase 7: Release, Distribution, and Maintenance (Weeks 23-24 and beyond)
The final phase involves packaging and releasing RustIRC 1.0. Installers and packages will be created for all target platforms (.msi for Windows, .dmg for macOS, and Flatpak/AppImage/.deb for Linux), automated via GitHub Actions. A project website and public announcements will launch the client. A community support channel (#RustIRC on Libera.Chat) and GitHub issue templates will be established to handle user feedback and bug reports, transitioning the project into a long-term maintenance and community-driven development cycle.[3]

Part V: Conclusion and Governance
This document outlines a comprehensive and strategic plan for the development of RustIRC, a modern IRC client designed to fill a clear void in the current software landscape. By synthesizing the proven strengths of mIRC, HexChat, and WeeChat, and building upon a foundation of modern, safe, and performant technology with Rust and Tokio, RustIRC is positioned to become the definitive IRC client for both new and veteran users.

The architectural principles of modularity, testability, and concurrency are not merely technical details; they are a direct response to the challenges that have led to the stagnation of previous-generation clients. The phased implementation plan ensures a structured, risk-managed path toward a feature-complete 1.0 release.

The ultimate success of RustIRC will depend not only on its technical excellence but also on its ability to foster an active and engaged community. Therefore, from its inception, the project will be governed by open-source principles, with clear contribution guidelines, transparent issue tracking, and active engagement with users and developers. By learning from the past and building for the future, RustIRC has the potential to deliver a superior IRC experience and ensure the continued vitality of the protocol for years to come. The next step is to execute Phase 1 and begin the journey of bringing this vision to reality.
