- Bounded message sizes
- Escape sequences properly handled
- Fuzz testing planned for parser

**Status**: âœ… Parser implemented with validation

### 3. DCC Security
**Risk Level**: High  
**Impact**: High  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**: DCC file transfers could be exploited for malware distribution or IP disclosure.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- DCC disabled by default
- File type filtering
- Virus scanning integration hooks
- IP masking through proxies
- User confirmation for all transfers

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for Phase 5

### 4. Script/Plugin Security
**Risk Level**: High  
**Impact**: High  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**: Malicious scripts could compromise system security.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Sandboxed script execution
- Permission system for script capabilities
- Script signing and verification
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- No filesystem access by default

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for Phase 4

## Project Risks

### 1. Scope Creep
**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Probability**: High  

**Description**: Feature additions could delay core functionality completion.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Strict phase boundaries defined
- Feature freeze during each phase
- Clear MVP definition
- Regular milestone reviews

**Status**: âœ… Phases 1-3 completed on schedule

### 2. Technical Debt
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**: Rushing implementation could lead to maintenance issues.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive documentation from start
- Code reviews via GitHub PRs
- Regular refactoring sessions
- Clippy warnings as errors in CI
- 100% implementation policy (no stubs)

**Status**: âœ… Zero technical debt achieved

### 3. Community Adoption
**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Impact**: Low  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**: Project may not gain traction in IRC community.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early engagement with IRC communities
- Feature parity with popular clients
- Modern, user-friendly interface
- Active development and responsiveness
- Open source with permissive license

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Ongoing outreach needed

### 4. Dependency Stability
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  

**Description**: Critical dependencies may become unmaintained.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Using well-established crates
- Minimal dependency tree
- Regular dependency audits
- Ability to fork and maintain critical deps
- Alternative implementations identified

**Status**: âœ… All dependencies stable

## Timeline Risks

### 1. Development Velocity
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  

**Description**: Development may take longer than estimated.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conservative time estimates
- Buffer time in each phase
- Parallel development where possible
- Clear task prioritization

## Summary

Overall project risk level: **LOW to MEDIUM**

Most critical risks have been successfully mitigated through Phase 1-3 completion. Remaining risks are primarily related to future phases (DCC, scripting) and ongoing operational concerns (community adoption, resource availability).

The project has demonstrated strong risk management with:
- Successful technology validation
- Comprehensive security implementation
- Zero technical debt
- Ahead-of-schedule delivery
- Robust testing and CI/CD

Regular risk reviews should continue at each phase boundary.
