### Key Features to Adopt (WeeChat)

1. Buffer merge/split capabilities
2. Smart filter for join/part/quit messages
3. Bar system for customizable UI elements
4. Trigger plugin for text manipulation
5. Script manager with repository integration
6. IRC capability negotiation state machine
7. Charset conversion per server/channel

### Implementation Notes (WeeChat)

- Nicklist as tree structure for large channels
- Incremental search in buffers
- Hook system for plugins with priority
- Configuration upgrade system for compatibility

## Synthesis for RustIRC

### Core Architecture Decisions (RustIRC)

#### Event System (RustIRC)

- Combine mIRC's comprehensive events with WeeChat's hook priority system
- Implement HexChat's plugin context isolation for stability
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous event handlers

#### Scripting Strategy (RustIRC)

- Primary: Lua via mlua (lightweight, sandboxable)
- Secondary: Python via PyO3 (power users)
- Native Rust plugins with stable ABI
- Event-driven API similar to mIRC's simplicity

#### UI/UX Design (RustIRC)

- WeeChat's buffer management as core concept
- HexChat's tree view for organization
- mIRC's dockable windows for flexibility
- Modern additions: tabs, splits, floating windows

#### Network Layer

- Multiple connections per process (all three clients)
- Per-network configuration (HexChat style)
- Capability negotiation (WeeChat implementation)
- SASL with mechanism preferences

#### DCC Implementation

- mIRC's robust protocol support
- Passive DCC for NAT traversal
- Resume support with rollback
- Bandwidth throttling

### Performance Targets

Based on analysis:

- Startup time: < 500ms (WeeChat baseline)
- Memory per channel: < 1MB (efficient nicklist)
- Message throughput: 10,000 msg/sec
- Scrollback: 100,000 lines per buffer

### Security Model

- Sandboxed scripting environment
- Certificate pinning per network
- DCC accept whitelist
- URL preview with sanitization
- Encrypted password storage

## Validation Requirements

### Critical Features

1. IRCv3.2 capability support
2. SASL PLAIN/EXTERNAL/SCRAM
3. Multiple server connections
4. UTF-8 with fallback encodings
5. TLS with SNI support

### Performance Tests

1. 100 simultaneous channels
2. 10,000 users in single channel
3. 1GB log file handling
4. 50 DCC transfers concurrent

### Compatibility Tests

1. All major IRC networks
2. Bouncer compatibility (ZNC, etc.)
3. Services interaction (NickServ, etc.)
4. Legacy server support (RFC1459)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **GUI Performance**: Use virtual scrolling for large buffers
- **Memory Usage**: Implement log rotation and buffer limits
- **Script Security**: Sandbox with resource limits
- **Network Issues**: Exponential backoff reconnection

### Adoption Risks

- **Migration Path**: Import settings from major clients
- **Learning Curve**: Progressive disclosure of features
- **Platform Differences**: Native UI guidelines per OS
- **Community**: Early adopter program with feedback

## Recommendations

### Phase 1 Priorities

1. Validate Iced rendering performance with IRC color codes
2. Prototype multi-server connection manager
3. Test Lua scripting integration and sandboxing
4. Benchmark message parsing throughput

### Architecture Guidelines

1. Event-driven core with actor model
2. Plugin host process isolation
3. Async I/O for all network operations
4. Immutable message passing between components

### Development Process

1. Start with TUI to validate core functionality
2. Add GUI after protocol layer stable
3. Implement scripting in Phase 4 as planned
4. Regular performance regression testing

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that combining mIRC's scripting power, HexChat's plugin architecture, and WeeChat's performance optimization creates an optimal feature set. RustIRC should prioritize:

1. **Robust Core**: Async networking with comprehensive IRC protocol support
2. **Flexible UI**: Both TUI and GUI with WeeChat-style buffers
3. **Powerful Scripting**: Lua primary with Python for advanced users
4. **Modern Features**: IRCv3, SASL, proper Unicode, IPv6
5. **Performance**: Handle scale that matches or exceeds WeeChat

This positions RustIRC as a modern client that respects IRC tradition while embracing contemporary development practices.
