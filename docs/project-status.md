- [x] TUI prototype with Ratatui
- [x] Network layer prototype with Tokio
- [x] Lua scripting prototype with mlua

#### Project Infrastructure
- [x] Initialized Cargo workspace with 6 crates
- [x] Set up GitHub repository
- [x] Configured CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [x] Added MIT license
- [x] Created comprehensive .gitignore

#### Documentation
- [x] Architecture guide with system design
- [x] 5 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- [x] Contributing guidelines
- [x] Development getting-started guide
- [x] IRC client analysis report
- [x] 249 detailed todo tasks across all phases

## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Research & Setup
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks  
**Key Tasks**:
- Technology validation (Iced vs GTK)
- Infrastructure setup
- Initial prototyping

### Phase 2: Core IRC Engine  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

### Phase 3: User Interface
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 4-10 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 core functionality

### Phase 4: Scripting & Plugins
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Basic UI from Phase 3

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phases 2-4

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: All features complete

### Phase 7: Release & Distribution
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 2+ weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 6 validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Complete remaining phase documentation (5-7)
2. Create remaining specification documents
3. Initialize Git repository
4. Set up GitHub/GitLab project
5. Configure initial CI/CD

### Short Term (Weeks 2-4)
1. Begin Phase 1 technology validation
2. Create GUI framework prototypes
3. Set up development environment
4. Recruit initial contributors
5. Establish communication channels

## Risk Register

### Active Risks
1. **GUI Framework Choice**: Iced maturity vs GTK complexity
2. **Timeline**: 6-month target is aggressive for feature set
3. **Community Building**: Need early adopters and contributors

### Mitigations
1. Early prototyping of both GUI options
2. Phased release approach (MVP → full features)
3. Active outreach to IRC communities

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- Lead Developer (1)
- Rust Developers (2-3 ideal)
- UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- Documentation Writer (part-time)
- Testers (community volunteers)

### Infrastructure
- GitHub repository (free)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions (free)
- IRC channel for coordination
- Project website (future)

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When
- Technology choices validated
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Development environment documented
- Initial community formed

### MVP (End of Phase 3)
- Connects to major IRC networks
- Basic GUI functional
- Multi-server support
- Core IRC commands working

### 1.0 Release (End of Phase 7)
- Feature parity with HexChat
- Lua scripting functional
- Cross-platform packages available
- Active user community

## Communication

### Channels
- GitHub Issues: Bug reports and features
- IRC: #rustirc on Libera.Chat (planned)
- Discord/Matrix: For real-time discussion
- Blog: Development updates (planned)

### Reporting
- Weekly progress updates
- Phase completion announcements
- Public roadmap maintenance
- Regular community engagement

## Notes

This is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses. Current status reflects the completion of initial planning and documentation phase. Active development will begin with Phase 1 technology validation.
