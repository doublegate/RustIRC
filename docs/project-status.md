## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3 Completion)
1. âœ… ~~Implement Iced GUI application structure and main window~~
2. âœ… ~~Create channel and server management UI components~~
3. âœ… ~~Build message display and input interfaces~~
4. âœ… ~~Implement user interface for connection configuration~~
5. âœ… ~~Integrate GUI with Phase 2 core IRC engine~~
6. ðŸ”„ **Remaining**: Complete tab reordering, context menus, multiline input mode

### Short Term (Phase 4 Start)
1. âœ… ~~Complete dual GUI/TUI interface implementation~~
2. âœ… ~~Add comprehensive user interaction features~~
3. âœ… ~~Implement theme and customization system~~
4. âœ… ~~Create robust message formatting and display~~
5. ðŸš€ **Ready**: Begin Phase 4 scripting integration (Lua/Python engines)

## Risk Register

### Active Risks
1. **GUI Framework Choice**: Iced maturity vs GTK complexity
2. **Timeline**: 6-month target is aggressive for feature set
3. **Community Building**: Need early adopters and contributors

### Mitigations
1. Early prototyping of both GUI options
2. Phased release approach (MVP â†’ full features)
3. Active outreach to IRC communities

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
