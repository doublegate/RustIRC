# RustIRC Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21 12:30 AM EDT  
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Scripting & Plugins (0% Complete) ðŸ”œ  
**Overall Progress**: Phases 1-3 complete with FULL FUNCTIONAL IRC CLIENT + GUI FIXES APPLIED, ready for Phase 4 development

## Overview

RustIRC has successfully completed Phases 1-3 with a **fully functional IRC client** capable of live server connectivity. The project now includes complete IRC protocol implementation with real-time server communication, comprehensive message handling (MOTD, PRIVMSG, JOIN, PART, LIST), user management, channel operations, TLS security, SASL authentication, full-featured GUI with themes and resizable panes, TUI mode, and CLI prototype. **All IRC commands are working with live servers** including `/connect`, `/join`, `/part`, `/list`, and real-time message display.

3. **Community Building**: Need early adopters and contributors

### Mitigations
1. Early prototyping of both GUI options
2. Phased release approach (MVP â†’ full features)
3. Active outreach to IRC communities
