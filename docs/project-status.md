## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Research & Setup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (August 14, 2025)  
**Duration**: Completed in 1 day  
**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Technology validation with 4 working prototypes
- ✅ Complete infrastructure setup
- ✅ All 6 crates successfully compiling
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline functional
- ✅ 5 ADRs documenting architectural decisions

### Phase 2: Core IRC Engine  
**Status**: Ready to Begin  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: ✅ Phase 1 completion verified

### Phase 3: User Interface
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 4-10 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 core functionality

### Phase 4: Scripting & Plugins
**Status**: Not Started  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Basic UI from Phase 3

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phases 2-4

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 3-6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: All features complete

### Phase 7: Release & Distribution
**Status**: Documentation Pending  
**Duration**: 2+ weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 6 validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 Start)
1. Implement async IRC protocol parser with full RFC compliance
2. Create multi-server connection management system
3. Build centralized state management with event sourcing
4. Develop comprehensive message routing and handling
5. Add robust error handling and reconnection logic

### Short Term (Phase 2 Completion)
1. Complete IRC protocol implementation
2. Validate multi-server functionality
3. Implement core IRC commands
4. Create automated testing for protocol compliance
5. Prepare foundation for Phase 3 UI development

## Risk Register

### Active Risks
1. **GUI Framework Choice**: Iced maturity vs GTK complexity
2. **Timeline**: 6-month target is aggressive for feature set
3. **Community Building**: Need early adopters and contributors

### Mitigations
1. Early prototyping of both GUI options
2. Phased release approach (MVP → full features)
3. Active outreach to IRC communities

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- Lead Developer (1)
- Rust Developers (2-3 ideal)
- UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- Documentation Writer (part-time)
- Testers (community volunteers)

### Infrastructure
- GitHub repository (free)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions (free)
- IRC channel for coordination
- Project website (future)

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete ✅
- ✅ Technology choices validated with prototypes
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline functional and tested
- ✅ Development environment documented and verified
- ✅ All 6 crates successfully compiling
- ✅ Build system working across platforms
- ✅ Foundation ready for Phase 2 development

### MVP (End of Phase 3)
- Connects to major IRC networks
- Basic GUI functional
- Multi-server support
- Core IRC commands working

### 1.0 Release (End of Phase 7)
- Feature parity with HexChat
- Lua scripting functional
- Cross-platform packages available
- Active user community

## Communication

### Channels
- GitHub Issues: Bug reports and features
- IRC: #rustirc on Libera.Chat (planned)
- Discord/Matrix: For real-time discussion
- Blog: Development updates (planned)

### Reporting
- Weekly progress updates
- Phase completion announcements
- Public roadmap maintenance
