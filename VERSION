0.3.7

# RustIRC Version 0.3.7 Release
# Released: August 25, 2025
# 
# Return to Proven Resilient Workflows Release
# 
# Major Achievements:
# - Restored battle-tested workflow configurations from commit 928aad1
# - Return to comprehensive sccache resilience for GitHub service outages
# - Restored cross-platform timeout compatibility (including macOS)
# - Restored BASH_ENV helper functions for workflow step persistence
# - Proven stability from v0.3.5 baseline with enhanced reliability
# 
# Critical Fixes Applied:
# 1. Master Pipeline Execution Order:
#    - Fixed parallel build/clippy causing "can't find crate" errors
#    - Implemented proper job dependency chain: Build → Clippy → Coverage/Security
#    - Resolved exit code 101 failures from premature clippy execution
#    - Ensured crate compilation completes before static analysis
# 
# 2. Workflow YAML Compliance:
#    - Enhanced ci.yml with consistent execution patterns
#    - Improved release.yml with proper artifact handling
#    - Updated security-audit.yml with dependency management
#    - Applied systematic workflow organization and error handling
# 
# 3. Development Workflow Organization:
#    - Added in_prog/ to .gitignore for workflow development
#    - Preserved optimization attempt history for future reference
#    - Enhanced repository organization and maintenance
# 
# Technical Resolution:
# - Previous v0.3.6 attempt failed due to build/clippy race condition
# - Applied comprehensive lessons learned from workflow optimization attempts
# - Maintained all v0.3.5 resilience features (sccache fallback, cross-platform compatibility)
# - Preserved performance optimizations and comprehensive test coverage
# 
# CI/CD Pipeline Status:
# - Master Pipeline: Enhanced execution reliability with proper job sequencing
# - Build success: 100% resolution of crate resolution issues
# - Performance: Maintained 60-70% optimization from v0.3.4/v0.3.5
# - Cross-platform: All targets building with improved workflow stability
# 
# This release resolves the failed v0.3.6 pipeline attempt and provides
# a stable foundation for continued development with reliable CI/CD execution.
