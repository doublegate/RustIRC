## [0.3.5] - 2025-08-24 (Comprehensive GitHub Actions Resilience: 1:35 AM EDT)

### Summary
Comprehensive GitHub Actions Resilience - This release implements robust fixes for GitHub cache service outages, sccache HTTP 400 errors, and cross-platform timeout compatibility. Enhanced sccache resilience automatically falls back to local disk cache when GitHub's cache service experiences issues ("Our services aren't available right now"). The updated mozilla-actions/sccache-action@v0.0.9 with sccache v0.10.0 provides enhanced reliability and proper error handling across all supported platforms.

### Critical Fixes

  - Automatic fallback to local disk cache mode (`SCCACHE_GHA_ENABLED=false`) when GitHub cache fails
  - Local disk cache configuration: `SCCACHE_DIR=$HOME/.cache/sccache`, `SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE=10G`
  - Updated to mozilla-actions/sccache-action@v0.0.9 with sccache v0.10.0 for enhanced reliability
  - Unified sccache configuration eliminates platform-specific complexity and circular dependencies

  - Clean, maintainable helper function architecture prevents future issues

- **macOS Timeout Compatibility**: Fixed `timeout: command not found` (exit code 127) on macOS runners
  - Implemented cross-platform timeout function using perl for macOS compatibility  
  - Proper numeric duration extraction to prevent "Substitution replacement not terminated" errors
  - Native timeout for Linux/Windows, perl-based timeout for macOS in unified helper function
