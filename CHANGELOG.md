### Implementation Enhancements (2025-08-21 10:25 PM EDT) ✅

#### Added
- Browser integration for URL clicking with `open` crate
- Real task spawning in testing framework with tokio runtime
- Connection state checking with circuit breaker validation
- Health check monitoring with automatic PING commands
- Recovery task scheduling for failed connections

#### Fixed
- Replaced placeholder URL opening with full implementation
- Testing environment task execution now properly async
- Connection recovery uses actual server state instead of mocks
- Health check performs real PING operations instead of placeholder

#### Improved
- Testing framework can now create runtime fallback for isolation
- Connection recovery integrates with state manager
- Health checks trigger automatic reconnection when needed
- Build status: Zero compilation errors across all implementations

### Advanced Interface Features Completed (2025-08-21 9:18 PM EDT) ✅

#### Added
- Complete tab completion system for commands, nicks, and channels
- Advanced key handling with IRC formatting shortcuts
- Multi-server command routing with validation
- Context-aware completion based on current server/channel
- History navigation with Ctrl+Up/Down
- Tab switching with Alt+1-9
- Professional-grade user experience matching industry IRC clients

### WARNING CLEANUP PHASE Completed (2025-08-17 4:51 PM EDT) ✅

#### Added
