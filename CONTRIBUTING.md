## Style Guidelines

### Rust Code Style

- **Format**: Always run `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Linting**: Ensure `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings
- **Naming**: Follow Rust naming conventions
  - `snake_case` for functions, variables, modules
  - `CamelCase` for types, traits
  - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs
- **Tests**: Write tests for new functionality

Example:
```rust
/// Connects to an IRC server with the given configuration.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `config` - Server configuration
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// Returns `Ok(ConnectionId)` on success, or an error if connection fails.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// let config = ServerConfig::new("irc.libera.chat", 6697);
/// let conn_id = client.connect(config).await?;
/// ```
pub async fn connect(&mut self, config: ServerConfig) -> Result<ConnectionId> {
    // Implementation
}
```
