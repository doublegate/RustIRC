## How to Use These Lists

1. **Task Tracking**: Check off completed items as you progress
2. **Time Estimation**: Each phase has estimated durations but adjust as needed
3. **Dependencies**: Some tasks depend on others - review before starting
4. **Parallel Work**: Many tasks can be done concurrently by different team members
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep lists updated with new discoveries and requirements

## Priority Levels

Tasks are implicitly prioritized:
- **Critical Path**: Tasks that block other work
- **Core Features**: Essential for basic functionality  
- **Enhanced Features**: Improve user experience
- **Nice-to-Have**: Can be deferred if needed

## Progress Tracking

Consider using:
- Git commits referencing todo items
- GitHub Issues linking to specific tasks
- Project board for visual progress
- Weekly reviews of completed items

## Contributing

When adding new tasks:
- Be specific and actionable
- Include acceptance criteria where helpful
- Note dependencies on other tasks
- Add to appropriate phase and section

## Notes

- Phase overlaps are intentional to maximize efficiency
- Some items may move between phases as development progresses
- Additional todos may be discovered during implementation
- Community feedback may introduce new requirements
