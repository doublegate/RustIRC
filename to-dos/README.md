# RustIRC Development Todo Lists

This directory contains detailed todo lists for each phase of RustIRC development. These lists provide granular task tracking to ensure comprehensive implementation of all features.

## Phase Todo Lists

### [Phase 1: Research & Setup](./phase1-todos.md) (Weeks 1-4)
Foundation work including technology validation, project infrastructure, and development environment setup.

### [Phase 2: Core IRC Engine](./phase2-todos.md) (Weeks 5-10)
Implementation of the fundamental IRC protocol, network layer, and state management system.

### [Phase 3: User Interface](./phase3-todos.md) (Weeks 11-20)
Development of both GUI (Iced) and TUI (ratatui) interfaces with full feature parity.

### [Phase 4: Scripting & Plugins](./phase4-todos.md) (Weeks 15-20)
Integration of Lua scripting engine and binary plugin system for extensibility.

### [Phase 5: Advanced Features](./phase5-todos.md) (Weeks 19-24)
Implementation of DCC protocol, complete IRCv3 support, and advanced security features.

### [Phase 6: Testing & Optimization](./phase6-todos.md) (Weeks 21-26)
Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and production readiness.

### [Phase 7: Release & Distribution](./phase7-todos.md) (Weeks 25-26+)
Packaging, distribution, and launch activities across all platforms.

## How to Use These Lists

1. **Task Tracking**: Check off completed items as you progress
2. **Time Estimation**: Each phase has estimated durations but adjust as needed
3. **Dependencies**: Some tasks depend on others - review before starting
4. **Parallel Work**: Many tasks can be done concurrently by different team members
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep lists updated with new discoveries and requirements

## Priority Levels

Tasks are implicitly prioritized:
- **Critical Path**: Tasks that block other work
- **Core Features**: Essential for basic functionality  
- **Enhanced Features**: Improve user experience
- **Nice-to-Have**: Can be deferred if needed

## Progress Tracking

Consider using:
- Git commits referencing todo items
- GitHub Issues linking to specific tasks
- Project board for visual progress
- Weekly reviews of completed items

## Contributing

When adding new tasks:
- Be specific and actionable
- Include acceptance criteria where helpful
- Note dependencies on other tasks
- Add to appropriate phase and section

## Notes

- Phase overlaps are intentional to maximize efficiency
- Some items may move between phases as development progresses
- Additional todos may be discovered during implementation
- Community feedback may introduce new requirements
